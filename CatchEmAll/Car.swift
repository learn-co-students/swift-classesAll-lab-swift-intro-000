    /*
     - throwing an error for the enum Transmission as being ambiguous, might just require the parameter to have a different name or the enum itself. It seems there was a redundant enum for Transmission within a child class, throwing the ambigious error. Single inheritance for Swift 3 makes sense.
     - the member has no value, being driftRight, is failing I think due to the object somehow not conforming. Can cast it to a variable and call it then? Still havent figured out why, but now it's working? Weird stuff.
