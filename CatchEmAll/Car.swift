class Car: Vehicle {
    let transmission: Transmission
    let cylinders: Int
    let milesPerGallon: Double
    
    init(name: String, weight: Double, maxSpeed:Double, transmission: Transmission, cylinders:
        Int, milesPerGallon: Double) {
            self.transmission = transmission
            self.cylinders = cylinders
            self.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon
                super.init(name: name, weight: weight, maxSpeed: maxSpeed)
    }
    
    func drive() {
        super.accelerate()
    }
    
    func brake() {
        super.decelerate()
    }
}

//Next, you need to implement the Car class in Car.swift. Car should inherit from Vehicle. It should add three new properties:
//A constant Transmission named transmission
//A constant Int called cylinders
//A constant Double called milesPerGallon
//Car should also have an initializer that takes six parameters:
//A String called name
//A Double called weight
//A Double called maxSpeed
//A Transmission called transmission
//An Int called cylinders
//A Double called milesPerGallon
//The initializer should first set the parameters specific to Car, then call super.init with the parameters required by the Vehicle superclass's initializer. Here's a hint: The Car initializer should look like this:
//init(name: String, weight: Double, maxSpeed: Double, transmission: Transmission, cylinders: Int, milesPerGallon: Double) {
//    self.transmission = transmission
//    self.cylinders = cylinders
//    self.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon
//    super.init(name: name, weight: weight, maxSpeed: maxSpeed)
//}
//Finally, Car should add two new methods, which again take no parameters and have no return value:
//drive(), which simply calls super.accelerate()
//brake(), which simply calls super.decelerate()
